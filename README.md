# DBuild

DBuild is a tool to build a distributable version of your code (currently: a workspace) from source-code in files. DTest supports unit tests. More doc in the [wiki](https://github.com/Dyalog/DBuildTest/wiki).
The only file that is required to run DBuild or DTest is DBuildTest.dyalog, the file CITA.json5 is used to manage the testing of the repository.

Save the file `DyalogBuild.dyalog` to your [MyUCMDs] folder. The [MyUCMDs] folder location is usually the first listed in the result of `]Setting cmddir`.
